# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area? I guess im so, so with time management. I manage it well enough to still work out or do yoga every day and I take 15 minute breaks after each assignment. This is only possible bc i wake up at 6:30 and get active before class. Once class has started and we're working I don't stop until it's all done, usually. So, idk if i'd call that good time management. 

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? It's something thats going to be repeated over and over and so I make something up to not have to do it over and over again. 

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Parameters are place holders for future arguments and are at the beginning of a function. Arguments are at the end of the function and get passed into the spaces held by parameters.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group? I feel like i made a really cluncky function for the last exercise and I want to see a better way.
